research:
- analyze correlations
- analyze outliers
- visualize distributions

- feature engineering:
	- scaling?
- potential interaction features? when would i need to do that

- modeling
- initial testing
- data tuning
- model tuning
- feature importance
- parameter tuning


tries:
1. random forest regressor, standard scaling -> R^2 = 0.53
